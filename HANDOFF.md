# Session Handoff - 2025-10-29

## What Was Built Today

### Two-Phase Reasoning Analysis System

**Phase 1: Pattern Extraction (Free)**
- Script: `workflows/analyze_reasoning_patterns.py`
- Regex-based indicator and action detection
- Shows what indicators used, how often, in what combinations
- Tested on 246 messages - works perfectly
- Run: `uv run python workflows/analyze_reasoning_patterns.py`

**Phase 2: LLM Structured Extraction (API)**
- Script: `workflows/extract_structured_reasoning.py`
- Uses Claude API to extract WHY reasoning
- Creates structured_reasoning table with causal chains
- Cost: ~$2.50 for 246 messages, ~$1.25 with Batch API
- Run: `uv run python workflows/extract_structured_reasoning.py --dry-run`

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed `start_capture.py` - now points to correct database path
- All workflow scripts updated to use `collector/` not `GPT_Implementation_Proposal/collector`

### Package Added
- `anthropic` package installed for Phase 2

## Current Status

- **246 messages** captured (up from 142)
- **7 models** tracked: deepseek-chat-v3.1, qwen3-max, claude-sonnet-4-5, gemini-2.5-pro, gpt-5, grok-4, unknown-model
- Collector working perfectly, capturing every 60 seconds
- All code committed to: https://github.com/sheehyct/Alpha-Arena-Reverse-Engineering.git

## What Phase 1 Revealed

- All models use MACD + RSI + MA + Volume + ATR consistently
- DeepSeek: 100% long entries, 97% mentions exits
- Claude: Balanced long/short (70%/65%)
- Gemini: Heavy short bias (100%)
- Stop loss placement: 39-88% mention rate by model

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Tonight)
1. Keep collector running: `cd collector && node server.js`
2. Let it accumulate 500-1000 messages over 24-48 hours
3. Leave nof1.ai tab open in Chrome

### Tomorrow (After Collection)
1. Set API key: `$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key'`
2. Check cost: `uv run python workflows/extract_structured_reasoning.py --dry-run`
3. Extract: `uv run python workflows/extract_structured_reasoning.py`
4. Analyze structured data with custom queries

### Analysis Ready
- Phase 1 can run anytime for quick insights
- Phase 2 best done once with full dataset
- Your $50 API credits can process 20,000+ messages

## Important Context

- Competition is active - models trading live
- Need 500-1000 messages for best analysis
- Phase 2 extracts: entry reasons, exit triggers, stop loss rationale, causal chains
- One-time processing creates permanent structured database
- Can then query: "Show DeepSeek trades with MACD+RSI entry and profit target exit"
