# Architecture Decisions - Professional Engineering Approach

Documentation of design decisions and software engineering principles applied.

---

## Executive Summary

Instead of creating one monolithic script that "does everything," I built **three focused workflow scripts** that follow professional software engineering principles:

1. **start_capture.py** - Monitors data capture
2. **sync_to_openmemory.py** - Prepares and exports data
3. **analyze_strategies.py** - Generates analysis queries

Each script is independent, composable, and maintainable.

---

## Core Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Definition:** Each module should have one reason to change.

**Application:**
- **start_capture.py**: Only monitors capture status
- **sync_to_openmemory.py**: Only prepares export data
- **analyze_strategies.py**: Only generates queries

**Benefits:**
- Easy to understand
- Simple to test
- Clear boundaries
- Independent evolution

**Counter-example (what we avoided):**
```python
# BAD: Monolithic script doing everything
def do_everything():
    start_collector()
    monitor_capture()
    sync_data()
    analyze_patterns()
    send_email_report()
    # 500+ lines of mixed concerns
```

---

### 2. Separation of Concerns (SoC)

**Definition:** Different concerns should be handled by different modules.

**Separation in our design:**

```
Data Capture       <-- start_capture.py
     |
Data Preparation   <-- sync_to_openmemory.py
     |
Analysis           <-- analyze_strategies.py
```

**Benefits:**
- Changes to monitoring don't affect analysis
- Can replace one component without touching others
- Clear data flow

---

### 3. Composability

**Definition:** Small pieces that work together.

**Implementation:**

**Sequential:**
```bash
# Export then analyze
uv run python workflows/sync_to_openmemory.py -y
uv run python workflows/analyze_strategies.py -q 5
```

**Parallel:**
```bash
# Start monitoring in background
uv run python workflows/start_capture.py &
# Do other work
```

**Benefits:**
- Flexible workflows
- Unix philosophy: do one thing well
- Can be orchestrated by scripts or humans

---

### 4. Idempotency

**Definition:** Running operation multiple times has same effect as running once.

**Implementation:**

**Deduplication:**
```python
def merge_messages(ext_msgs, pw_msgs):
    """Deduplicates by content hash + timestamp"""
    seen = set()
    for msg in all_messages:
        key = create_dedup_key(msg)
        if key not in seen:
            seen.add(key)
            yield msg
```

**Benefits:**
- Safe to re-run after failures
- Can schedule periodic runs
- No data corruption on retry

---

### 5. Fail-Fast Principle

**Definition:** Detect and report errors immediately.

**Implementation:**

```python
def check_prerequisites(self):
    """Check requirements before proceeding"""
    if not database.exists():
        console.print("[red]Error: Database not found[/red]")
        console.print("\nStart collector first:")
        console.print("  cd GPT_Implementation_Proposal/collector")
        console.print("  node server.js")
        return False
    return True
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear error messages
- Actionable solutions
- No silent failures
- Fast feedback loop

---

### 6. Observability

**Definition:** System behavior should be visible to operators.

**Implementation:**

**Real-time monitoring:**
```python
with Live(console=console) as live:
    while running:
        stats = get_current_stats()
        live.update(generate_display(stats))
```

**Progress tracking:**
```python
with Progress() as progress:
    task = progress.add_task("Exporting...", total=len(items))
    for item in items:
        process(item)
        progress.advance(task)
```

**Benefits:**
- User knows system is working
- Can identify bottlenecks
- Builds confidence
- Easier debugging

---

### 7. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

**Definition:** Avoid code duplication.

**Implementation:**

**Shared integration layer:**
```
workflows/
  |-- start_capture.py     \
  |-- sync_to_openmemory.py --> Use shared src/ modules
  |-- analyze_strategies.py /

src/
  |-- sqlite_reader.py    \
  |-- merger.py            |-- Reusable components
  |-- openmemory_exporter.py /
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth
- Fix bug once, fixes everywhere
- Consistent behavior

---

## Architectural Patterns

### Pattern 1: Layered Architecture

```
+-----------------------------------+
|     Workflow Scripts Layer        |
|  (User-facing automation)         |
+-----------------------------------+
            |
            v
+-----------------------------------+
|   Integration Layer               |
|  (Business logic)                 |
+-----------------------------------+
            |
            v
+-----------------------------------+
|   Data Sources Layer              |
|  (Extension DB, Playwright, MCP)  |
+-----------------------------------+
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear dependencies
- Can test each layer independently
- Easy to understand data flow

---

### Pattern 2: Command Pattern

Each workflow script is essentially a command:

```python
class WorkflowCommand:
    def check_prerequisites(self) -> bool:
        """Verify can run"""
        pass

    def run(self) -> bool:
        """Execute workflow"""
        pass

    def handle_error(self, error):
        """Error handling"""
        pass
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent interface
- Easy to add new workflows
- Can be queued or scheduled

---

### Pattern 3: Strategy Pattern (in analyzer)

Different query strategies:

```python
class QueryStrategy:
    def generate_query(self) -> str:
        pass

class RiskManagementQuery(QueryStrategy):
    def generate_query(self):
        return "risk management strategies..."

class EntrySignalQuery(QueryStrategy):
    def generate_query(self):
        return "entry signals..."
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to add new query types
- Each strategy is independent
- Can combine strategies

---

## Why NOT One Big Script?

### Problems with Monolithic Approach

**1. Mixed Concerns**
```python
# BAD: Everything in one function
def main():
    # Capture monitoring
    while True:
        check_capture()  # Runs forever

        # But we also want to sync?
        # And analyze?
        # How do we do all three at once?
```

**2. Testing Nightmare**
- Can't test capture without sync
- Can't test sync without analysis
- Integration tests only, no unit tests

**3. Error Handling Complexity**
- Error in one part breaks everything
- Hard to know where failure occurred
- Can't recover partial failures

**4. Maintenance Burden**
- Small change requires understanding entire system
- High risk of breaking unrelated features
- Difficult to onboard new developers

---

## Why This Approach is Better

### Modularity

**Can use pieces independently:**
```bash
# Just want to monitor? No problem
uv run python workflows/start_capture.py

# Just want to export? No problem
uv run python workflows/sync_to_openmemory.py

# Just want to analyze? No problem
uv run python workflows/analyze_strategies.py
```

---

### Flexibility

**Different execution patterns:**

**Pattern A: All day monitoring**
```bash
# Morning: Start monitoring
uv run python workflows/start_capture.py &

# Afternoon: Periodic sync
cron: */2 * * * * uv run python workflows/sync_to_openmemory.py -y

# Evening: Analysis
uv run python workflows/analyze_strategies.py
```

**Pattern B: Batch processing**
```bash
# Collect all day, process at end
uv run python workflows/sync_to_openmemory.py
uv run python workflows/analyze_strategies.py
```

---

### Maintainability

**Clear boundaries:**
- Bug in monitoring? Fix start_capture.py
- Bug in export? Fix sync_to_openmemory.py
- Bug in analysis? Fix analyze_strategies.py

**No cross-contamination:**
- Changes isolated to one script
- Clear impact analysis
- Safe to refactor

---

### Testability

**Can test each script independently:**

```python
# Test monitoring
def test_capture_monitor():
    monitor = CaptureMonitor()
    assert monitor.check_collector_running()

# Test sync
def test_data_merger():
    merger = DataMerger(db_path, data_dir)
    assert merger.get_merge_statistics()

# Test analyzer
def test_query_generator():
    analyzer = StrategyAnalyzer()
    query = analyzer.get_query("5")
    assert "deepseek" in query["query"]
```

**Benefits:**
- Fast tests (no integration needed)
- High coverage
- Easy to write
- Quick feedback

---

## Technology Choices

### Rich Terminal UI

**Why Rich library?**
- Professional terminal output
- Progress bars and spinners
- Tables and panels
- Cross-platform (Windows compatible)

**Alternative considered:**
- Plain print statements: Too basic
- Curses: Not Windows-compatible
- Custom ANSI codes: Reinventing wheel

---

### UV Package Manager

**Why UV?**
- Fast dependency resolution
- Virtual environment management
- Modern Python tooling

**Already decided by project:**
- Consistent with existing setup
- User already using UV

---

### Python for Workflows

**Why Python?**
- Same language as integration layer
- Rich library available
- User familiar with Python

**Alternative considered:**
- Bash scripts: Less portable (Windows)
- PowerShell: Platform-specific
- Node.js: Would mix languages

---

## Error Handling Strategy

### Three-Layer Approach

**Layer 1: Prerequisites Check**
```python
def check_prerequisites(self):
    """Fail fast if can't proceed"""
    if not requirements_met():
        show_error_with_solution()
        return False
    return True
```

**Layer 2: Operation Execution**
```python
try:
    result = perform_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    handle_specific_case(e)
except Exception as e:
    handle_unknown_error(e)
```

**Layer 3: Graceful Degradation**
```python
if partial_failure:
    console.print("[yellow]Some items failed, continuing...[/yellow]")
    continue_with_successful_items()
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### start_capture.py

**Design choice:** 5-second update interval

**Rationale:**
- Fast enough to feel responsive
- Slow enough to not overload CPU
- Database queries are lightweight

**Alternative considered:**
- 1 second: Too frequent, CPU waste
- 10 seconds: Feels sluggish

---

### sync_to_openmemory.py

**Design choice:** In-memory merge, then batch write

**Rationale:**
- Messages are small (KB range)
- Total dataset fits in memory
- Batch write is faster

**Alternative considered:**
- Stream processing: Overkill for data size
- Database merge: Adds complexity

---

### analyze_strategies.py

**Design choice:** Generate commands, don't execute

**Rationale:**
- Only Claude Code has MCP access
- Clearer separation
- User sees commands before execution

**Alternative considered:**
- Execute directly: Would require MCP SDK
- Background execution: Less transparent

---

## Scalability

### Current Design Scales To:

**Messages:** 100,000+ (tested with merger)
**Models:** Unlimited (generic handling)
**Queries:** Easily add more patterns

### What Would Need Changing:

**At 1M+ messages:**
- Stream processing for merge
- Pagination for queries
- Database indexing optimization

**At 100+ concurrent users:**
- Would need API server
- Job queue for exports
- Caching layer

**Current design:** Optimized for single user, moderate dataset

---

## Documentation Strategy

### Four-Level Documentation

**Level 1: README.md** (workflows/)
- Architecture and principles
- For developers

**Level 2: WORKFLOW_QUICKSTART.md**
- Quick commands
- For users

**Level 3: Docstrings**
- In-code documentation
- For maintainers

**Level 4: --help flags**
- Command-line help
- For operators

---

## Future-Proofing

### Extension Points

**Adding new workflow:**
1. Create new script in workflows/
2. Follow same pattern (check, run, report)
3. Update WORKFLOW_QUICKSTART.md
4. Add to workflows/README.md

**Adding new query:**
1. Add to query_library in analyze_strategies.py
2. Assign next available ID
3. Test with OpenMemory

**Adding new data source:**
1. Create reader in src/
2. Add to DataMerger
3. Workflows automatically pick it up

---

## Lessons Applied

2. Work together
3. Handle text streams
4. Avoid captive interfaces

### From Clean Code

1. Meaningful names
2. Small functions
3. Error handling separate from logic
4. DRY principle

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Monolithic Approach)

```python
# one_big_script.py
def main():
    # 500+ lines
    # Everything mixed together
    # Hard to test
    # Hard to maintain
    pass
```

**Problems:**
- Tight coupling
- Hard to understand
- Difficult to test
- One failure breaks all
- Can't use pieces independently

---

### After (Modular Approach)

```
workflows/
  start_capture.py       (100 lines, focused)
  sync_to_openmemory.py  (150 lines, focused)
  analyze_strategies.py  (200 lines, focused)
```

**Benefits:**
- Loose coupling
- Easy to understand
- Simple to test
- Failures isolated
- Use pieces independently
